# Nomai Text Printer
This is a utility mod meant to be used alongside New Horizons. With this mod enabled, pressing M while the Nomai Translator is hovering over text will print information about the entire wall of text. 
For the most part, this text can be copy-and-pasted directly into the json files for a NH addon. This is especially useful with the arcInfo.

# Limitations
* This mod does not get information about the normal or xml files, so those will still need to be entered manually.<br />
