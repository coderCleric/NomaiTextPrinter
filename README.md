# Nomai Text Printer
This is a utility mod meant to be used alongside New Horizons. With this mod enabled, pressing M while the Nomai Translator is hovering over text will print information about the entire wall of text. 
For the most part, this info can be copy-and-pasted directly into the json files for a NH addon. This is especially useful when used to generate the arcInfo of text that has been manually placed with 
the [Unity Explorer Mod](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/unityexplorer/).

# Limitations
* This mod does not get information about the normal or xml files, so those will still need to be entered manually.<br />
* Arc variants are also not captured, so this mod is best used with text that is purely seeded.<br />
